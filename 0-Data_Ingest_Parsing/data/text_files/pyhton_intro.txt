    Python is a high-level, versatile, and easy-to-learn programming language that 
    is widely used across various domains such as web development, data science, machine 
    learning, automation, and software development. Known for its simple syntax and readability, 
    Python allows developers to write clean and efficient code with fewer lines compared to many 
    other languages. It supports multiple programming paradigms including object-oriented,
    procedural, and functional programming, making it flexible for different types of projects. 
    With a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks like NumPy, Pandas, Django, and TensorFlow,
    Python empowers beginners and professionals alike to build powerful applications quickly. 
    Its strong community support and cross-platform compatibility further make it one of the most 
    popular and in-demand programming languages in the world today.

    Here are some key features of Python 

Simple & Easy to Learn – Python has a clean, readable syntax close to English, making it beginner-friendly.

Interpreted Language – No need for compilation; Python code runs directly, making debugging easier.

Cross-Platform – Works on Windows, Mac, Linux, and even mobile/embedded systems.

Open Source & Free – Anyone can use and modify it without cost.

Extensive Libraries – Comes with rich standard libraries and third-party modules for almost every domain (AI, Data Science, Web, etc.).

Object-Oriented & Multi-Paradigm – Supports OOP, procedural, and functional programming styles.

Dynamic Typing – No need to declare variable types; Python decides at runtime.

High-Level Language – Focuses on problem-solving rather than low-level details like memory management.
